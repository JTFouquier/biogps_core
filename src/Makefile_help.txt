|  BioGPS Make v0.1  |
+--------------------+

Primary make commands:
  all           Execute a normal build (default)
  full          Execute a full build (forcing recompression of all files)
  steal         Run the StealJS build script
                    (outputs: minified JS2)
  compress      Run Django-Compress, updating only files that have changed
                    (outputs: minified JS, CSS, LESS)
                    (aliases: css, less, djangocompress)
  clean         Remove files generated by normal builds

Extra make commands:
  help          Print out this help info (Makefile_help.txt)
  docs          Generate documentation for JS2
  compress_force  (same as compress, but forces rebuild of all output files)
  clean_tmp     Remove temp files generated during LessCSS builds
                This sometimes breaks the dev server, so it is not used
  lint          Runs jslint on the JS2 output. Currently not working.
