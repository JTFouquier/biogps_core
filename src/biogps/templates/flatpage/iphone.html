		<h1>BioGPS is an iPhone App too!</h1>
		<p>
		    So you're sitting in a lecture scrutinizing the speaker's PowerPoint,
		    or in a meeting going over your group's latest data.
		    And up comes a gene you don't recognize.  <b>What to do?</b>
		</p>
		<p>Fear not, intrepid scientist, for now you can <b>fit the power of BioGPS in your pocket!</b>
		    <br>All you need is an Apple® iPhone® or iPod touch® with iPhone OS 3.0 or newer.

		<h2>What can I do with it?</h2>
		<p>
		    Although every scientist who visits a gene portal wants to <b>view gene annotation</b>,
		    the specific reasons are different for every person. A geneticist may be here to
		    find the phenotype of the <b>mouse knockout</b>. A cell biologist may be here to view
		    our <b>Gene Atlas expression profiles</b>. A molecular biologist may want to find
		    information on <b>protein domains</b>. If everyone has their unique interests, gene
		    portals should be adaptable to suit your individual needs.
		</p><p>
		    Now you can access this information <b>when you need it</b>, whether you are at a
		    conference, meeting, or just lunch. The BioGPS app puts the knowledge of the
		    genome at your fingertips.
		</p>
