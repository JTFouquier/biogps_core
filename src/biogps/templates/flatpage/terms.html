<h2>The Scripps Research Institute BioGPS Website and Database</h2>
<h2>Terms of Use</h2>

<br>
<p>
The BioGPS website ("BioGPS") has been designed to provide you with access to a gene portal system that is maintained by The Scripps Research Institute ("TSRI"). TSRI authorizes you to access and use BioGPS and the data and information contained on this BioGPS website and database under the conditions set forth below.
</p>
<p>
BioGPS content can be search and browsed without registering for an account.  The BioGPS website allows for optional user registration that enables personalization features, including but not limited to saving gene lists and registering plugins. To register as a BioGPS user, you will need to choose a user name and password, and provide your email address. You may also provide your name and company and/or university affiliation to gain access to certain functions of BioGPS, such as sharing general and scientific data and plug-ins with other BioGPS users. Your name, email address and affiliation may be considered personal data depending upon your country of residence. We process the personal data in the United States for the purpose of creating your BioGPS user account and for user identification in relation to data sharing of general and scientific data and plug-ins. Privacy laws and regulations vary from country to country, and the United States provides a level of privacy protection that is less strict than the EU and other countries such as Switzerland.
</p>
<p>
By providing your email address and optionally your name and affiliation in creating a BioGPS user account, you hereby consent to the collection and use of your personal information in accordance with TSRI's privacy policies, available at http://www.scripps.edu/terms_of_use.html.
