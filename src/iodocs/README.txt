This folder stores JSON files used by IODocs (https://github.com/mashery/iodocs) to document REST APIs provided by BioGPS and MyGene.Info. You need to use symbolic links to map these *.json files into "public/data" folder under IODocs installation folder.

To update API documents, edit JSON files in this folder, commit and push changes to the repository and check out the new version in biogps_dev_small instance.
